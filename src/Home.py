    From the [website](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi): 
    > The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between sequences. 
    The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the 
    statistical significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships 
    between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families. 
    
    This WebApp is a simple interface to run blast locally against your own sequences. You can then filter the 
    results and save them in a file.
